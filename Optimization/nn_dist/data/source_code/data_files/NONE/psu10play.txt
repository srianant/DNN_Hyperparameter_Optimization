The file contains data for the school year 2010–11 sorted by the NCES assigned school identification code (NCESSCH). Data
presented in this release are available in two formats—SAS datasets (.sas7bdat) and tab-separated values text files (.txt).

Note that starting with the 2002–03 CCD, all numeric fields contain a -1 to indicate missing and a -2 to indicate not applicable.
Previously, numeric fields contained an “M” to indicate missing and an “N” to indicate not applicable.  Character fields continue
to use “M” for missing and “N” for not applicable. “AN” and “N” are alphanumeric and numeric data, respectively.
