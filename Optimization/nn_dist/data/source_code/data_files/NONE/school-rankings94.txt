                 Graduate School Rankings - 1994


U.S.NEWS & WORLD REPORT, MARCH 21, 1994

                           LAW

METHODOLOGY Here's how the rankings were determined for the
nation's 176 accredited law schools. There were five categories:
student selectivity, placement success, faculty resources and
two separate measures of institutional reputation.

STUDENT SELECTIVITY was based on the following data for
full-time J.D. students in the fall 1993 entering class: median
undergraduate grade point average (40 percent of the category
total), median score on the Law School Admission Test (50
percent) and percentage of applicants accepted (10 percent).

PLACEMENT SUCCESS was based on the percentage of the 1993
graduating class employed at graduation (30 percent); the
percentage employed six months after graduation (40 percent);
the ratio of last year's on-campus recruiters to the number of
1993 graduates (5 percent) and the median starting salary,
excluding bonuses, for '93 graduates employed in the private
sector (25 percent).

FACULTY RESOURCES was based on the school's total expenditures
per student for instruction, library and supporting services
during the school year beginning in fall 1992 (75 percent); the
number of books, microfilm rolls and microfiche in the law
library divided by the number of law students (5 percent), and
the current student-to-teacher ratio (20 percent).

REPUTATION was based on two surveys conducted this winter. In
one, deans and senior law school faculty rated by quartiles the
reputation of each school. In the other, 3,000 practicing
lawyers, hiring partners and senior judges were asked to rate
each school by quartiles based upon their appraisals of the work
of recent graduates of that school.

OVERALL RANK was determined by converting into percentiles the
scores achieved by each school in the above categories. The
highest score in each category--or subcategory--was given a
value of 100 percent. The scores for all the other schools were
then converted into percentiles by figuring them as percentages
of the score achieved by the No. 1 school and then were number
ranked in descending order. (The ranks for selectivity,
placement success and faculty resources were determined by
totaling the weighted percentiles of their subvariables.) Next,
the number ranks of the five indicators were weighted: The two
reputational surveys and placement success each accounted for 20
percent of the final score; student selectivity for 25 percent
and faculty resources for 15 percent. Final rankings were
determined by totaling the five weighted number-ranked scores.
The weighted score for the top school was then given a value of
100 percent. Scores for the others were determined by figuring
their totals as percentages of the score achieved by the No. 1
school.

METHODOLOGY Here's how U.S. NEWS determined the rankings for the
nation's 273 accredited M.B.A. programs. There were five
categories: student selectivity, placement success, graduation
rate and two measures of institutional reputation.

STUDENT SELECTIVITY was based on three indicators for full-time
M.B.A.'s entering in the fall of 1993: average scores on the
Graduate Management Admission Test (accounting for 65 percent of
the category total), undergraduate grade point average (30
percent) and the percentage of applicants accepted (5 percent).

PLACEMENT SUCCESS was based on four indicators for the full-time
M.B.A. class that graduated in 1993: the percentage employed at
graduation (30 percent of the category total), the percentage
employed three months after graduation (25 percent), their
median starting salaries excluding sign-up or other bonuses (40
percent) and the ratio of the number of last year's on-campus
M.B.A. recruiters to the number of 1993 graduates (5 percent).

GRADUATION RATE represented the average percentage of students
in the 1992 and 1993 graduating classes earning M.B.A.'s within
two years.

REPUTATION was determined by two U.S. NEWS surveys conducted
this winter. In the first, business school deans and M.B.A.
program directors ranked by quartile the reputation of each
M.B.A. program and in the second, 2,000 chief executive officers
representing a cross section of the largest U.S. corporations
were asked to select the 25 top graduate business schools in the
nation.

OVERALL RANK was determined by converting into percentiles the
scores achieved by each school in each of the above categories.
The highest score achieved by the top school in each
category--or subcategory--was given a value of 100 percent. The
scores for all the other schools were then converted into
percentiles by figuring them as percentages of the score
achieved by the No. 1 school and then were number ranked in
descending order. (The scores in the categories of placement
success and student selectivity--made up of the variables listed
above--were determined by totaling the weighted percentiles of
these variables.) Next, the number ranks of the five indicators
were weighted: The two reputational surveys each accounted for
20 percent of the final score; student selectivity for 25
percent; placement success for 30 percent, and graduation rate
for 5 percent. The final rankings were then determined by
totaling the five weighted number-ranked scores. The weighted
score for the top school was given a value of 100 percent. The
scores for all the others were then determined by figuring their
totals as percentages of the score achieved by the No. 1 school.

                         MEDICAL

METHODOLOGY U.S. NEWS recognizes that while all medical schools
train physicians and do research, they differ in emphasis.
Hence, we  divided the 126 medical schools into two categories:
those more oriented toward research and those more oriented
toward training primary care physicians. Based upon suggestions
from medical educators, we placed the 60 schools receiving the
most research money from the National Institutes of Health in
one category and all the rest in a category we call
comprehensive schools. All the schools were ranked according to
the following criteria:

STUDENT SELECTIVITY was based on data for the fall 1993 entering
class: undergraduate grade point average (accounting for 30
percent), average scores on the Medical College Admission Test
(65 percent) and the percentage of applicants accepted (5
percent).

FACULTY RESOURCES represented the 1993 total medical school
full-time faculty-to-student ratio.

REPUTATION was based on the results of separate surveys. In the
first, medical-school deans and senior faculty were asked to
rank by quartile the reputation of the schools in their
category. In the second, 3,000 directors of intern-residency
programs were asked to select the 20 best medical schools among
either research or comprehensive schools based upon their
appraisals of recent graduates.

RESEARCH ACTIVITY, used only in ranking the research-oriented
schools, was based on the total dollar amount of NIH grants
awarded to the medical school and its affiliated hospitals in
1993.

OVERALL RANK was determined by converting into percentiles the
scores achieved by each school in the above categories. The
highest score in each category--or subcategory--was given a
value of 100 percent. The scores for all the other schools were
then converted into percentiles by figuring them as percentages
of the score achieved by the No. 1 school and then were number
ranked in descending order. (The scores in the student
selectivity category were determined by totaling the weighted
percentiles of its sub-variables.) Next, the number ranks of the
five indicators were weighted: The two reputational surveys and
student selectivity each accounted for 20 percent of the final
score; faculty resources for 10 percent, and research activity
for 30 percent. (For the comprehensive schools, the two
reputational surveys each counted 30 percent of the final score;
student selectivity for 25 percent, and faculty resources 15
percent.) The final rankings were then determined by totaling
the five weighted number-ranked scores. The weighted score for
the top school was given a value of 100 percent. The scores for
all the others were then determined by figuring their totals as
percentages of the score achieved by the No. 1 school.

                         ENGINEERING


METHODOLOGY Here's how U.S. NEWS determined the rankings for the nation's 209
graduate engineering programs: There were five categories-- faculty resources,
research activity, student selectivity and two separate measures of
institutional reputation.

STUDENT SELECTIVITY was based on three statistics for doctoral and master's
degree candidates who enrolled in the fall of 1993: average scores in the
quantitative and analytical parts of the Graduate Record Examination (each
counts for 45 percent of the category) and percentage of applicants accepted in
the program (10 percent).

FACULTY RESOURCES was based on these variables: the percentage of full-time
faculty who held Ph.D.'s during the current academic year (20 percent of the
total); the current ratio of both full-time doctoral (25 percent) and master's
degree candidates to full-time faculty (10 percent); the proportion of
engineering graduate students who were Ph.D. candidates (20 percent), and the
number of Ph.D. degrees granted in 1993 (25 percent).

RESEARCH ACTIVITY was based on two indicators: the 1993 dollar total of the
public and privately funded research administered by the engineering school (60
percent) and that total divided by the number of faculty members engaged in
research (40 percent).

REPUTATION was determined by two U.S. NEWS reputational surveys conducted this
winter. In the first, engineering school deans and deans of academic affairs
were asked to rate by quartiles the reputation of each graduate engineering
program. In the second, 1,400 practicing engineers were asked to select the 25
top graduate engineering programs based upon their experiences with recent
graduates of those programs.

OVERALL RANK was determined by converting into percentiles the scores achieved
by each school in the above categories. The highest score in each category--or
subcategory--was given a value of 100 percent. The scores for the other schools
were then converted into percentiles by figuring them as percentages of the
score achieved by the No. 1 school and ranked in descending order. The ranking
for research activity, faculty resources and selectivity were determined by
totaling the weighted percentiles of their sub-variables. Next, the number ranks
in the five indicators were weighted: The two reputational surveys each
accounted for 20 percent of the final score; faculty resources and research
activity for 25 percent each, and student selectivity for 10 percent. The final
rankings were then determined by totaling the five weighted number ranked
scores. The weighted score for the top school was given a value of 100 percent.
The scores for all the others were then determined by figuring their totals as
percentages of the score achieved by the No. 1 school.

                          FINE ARTS

METHODOLOGY Here's how U.S. NEWS determined the rankings of
graduate programs in drama/theater (master of fine arts), film
(master of fine arts), music (master of music), art/fine arts
(master of fine arts), architecture (master of architecture),
social work (master of social work) and public health (master of
public health). This winter, questionnaires were sent to deans,
top administrators and senior faculty of the accredited schools
in each discipline. In architecture, only schools offering the
master of architecture degree were included. In most cases,
questionnaires were sent to three respondents at each school.
Respondents rated only the institutions in their own
disciplines. They were asked to rank the reputations of
accredited schools by placing them into tiers of academic
quality, taking into account a school's scholarship, curriculum
and the quality of its faculty and graduate students. A 5-point
scale was used: A school considered ``distinguished'' was given
5 points, ``strong'' counted for 4, ``good'' for 3, ``adequate''
for 2 and ``marginal'' for 1. ``Don't knows'' did not count.
U.S. NEWS totaled the number of points for each school and
divided the total by the number of respondents who rated that
school. Schools were ranked in descending order based on their
average scores. The highest possible score was 5.0. Reputation
surveys by Market Facts Inc. Response rates: architecture, 60.4
percent; public health, 58.8 percent; social work, 51.9 percent;
arts, 34.4 percent; drama, 52.7 percent; film, 53.9 percent;
music, 55.5 percent.
