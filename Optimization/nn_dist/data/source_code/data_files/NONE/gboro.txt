        Goldsboro Schools Among North Carolina's Oldest

 The Goldsboro City School District, which was 100 years old in 1981-82,
was one of the first public school systems established in the state.

 The first class graduated in 1885.

 Records show the old "Middle" building erected in 1857 on William Street
was the site of the first Goldsboro City School. The building was used
variously as a female college, as both Confederate and Union hospitals and
a high school for boys and girls.

 "There had been an assortment of small private elementary schools in the 
area since the city was founded in the 1840's," Superintendant Ken Brinson
said. "The Civil War interrupted virtually all educational efforts."

 "The establishment of a move for public education began in earnest between
1875 and 1885."

 Free schools established during that period in order:

 Greensboro, Raleigh, Salisbury, Goldsboro, Durham, Charlotte, Wilmington
and Winston-Salem.

 "The first black school of any size was built in 1870 and was called the
Wilberforce Building on the site of School Street School," Brinson said.
"The Quakers or Friends were early sponsors of black education."

 "When public schools began, the Quakers withdrew. The school term prior
to 1887 was only two or three months annually. In that year the graded
school system was expanded to include black schools and facilities were
greatly improved."

 Brinson said Julius A Bonitz, a German immigrant, established a 
newspaper in Goldsboro in 1867. "Bonitz was a champion for good causes."

 "In 1880, he launched a campaign for a modern, public school system in
Goldsboro. Three new lawyers in town helped in this effort by writing 
editorials and talking up the idea."

  They were Frank A Daniels, Joseph E Robinson and Charles B Aycock.

  "It took two votes of the citizens and the second vote went for the
establishment of free schools in Goldsboro," Brinson continued. "The
state legislature, by a special act in 1881, formally established
Goldsboro Graded Schools."

  "The law provided that tax money from white property holders should
support white schools and that tax from black property holders would
support black schools."

  "The building deemed most suitable for the new system was the (female)
college on William Street."

  "The town voted a bond issue of $32,000 to purchase the building and
the land around it," he said. "Two side buildings were later erected."

  Brinson noted that the city's population in 1881 was 3,286 - more than
that of Durham and Greensboro.

  "On September 8, 1881, a special school tax was levied at 20 cents on
each hundred dollars worth of property," Brinson said. "This tax was
continued and increased until 1980, when it was abolished."

  Brinson said parents who refused to pay the tax had to pay tuition
in order for their children to attend school.

  "To overcome problems of the citizens feeling that teachers in the
private schools were superior, the local private teachers were persuaded
to come to work for the new school system," he said.

  "This helped to soothe agitated feelings about the new school."

  The first teachers were a Mr Adney, Ed Kennedy, Mrs M O Humphrey,
Mrs Anna Craton, Miss Mary Carrow, Miss Fanny Everett and Ms Olivia 
Hillard.

  The first board of trustees consisted of Julius A Bonitz, E B Borden,
Henry Lee, B F Arrington, H L Grant, W A Deans and Nathan Boyette. The
first superintendent hired was E P Moses from Tennessee.

  "When the school opened in September 1881, there were 216 girls and
177 boys for a total enrollment of 393. Four years later, there were
650 students. At first there were only nine grades, but those graduating
were fully prepared for college," Brinson said.

  "In 1883, the Supreme Court declared the law unconstitutional that
separate taxes support the white and black school districts," he
continued. "At the next session of the legislature, the law was amended
so that white and black schools were supported from the common tax fund."

  In 1885, the first class graduated from the school. The students were
John Bassett, Willie Boon, E B Borden, Jr, Rob Cobb, Hiram Grant, Bettie
Griswold, Diana Galick, Betsy Hill, Louisa Hill, Robert Hooks, Charles
Miller, Hugh Miller and Louisa Miller.

  The first class to come all the way through the grades and graduate was
in 1891. The school had by then expanded to include 10 grades. The 12th
grade was added in 1906. The black school had 10 grades until 1925. The
first black class graduated in 1907.

  By 1895, the number of students in the schools necessitated 
construction of two new buildings on the William Street campus; one on
either side of the originial building. Later construction and other 
additions:

  1910 - School Street built

  1915 - High school built on the corner of William and Vine streets. 
         Walnut Street School constructed, Virginia Street School built, 
         brick replacement for School Street School.

  In 1929, the first requirements were formalized for teaching certificates.
Two years of college were required for elementary teachers, four years
for high school teachers.

  It was not until 1933 that a nine-month school term was added at the
expense of local taxpayers, according to records. In 1939, an optional 12th
grade was added to the curriculum. In 1943, the 12th grade was made manditory
by the state.

  Kindergarden was added in 1974.

  "Clearly Goldsboro City schools have made great progress since the early
years," Brinson concluded.

  "The system has been accredited by the Southern Association of Schools
and Colleges for many years. It is also now state accredited."

  "With the 'Eight Point Plan for Execellence,' it will be the best school
district in eastern North Carolina."
