module Middleware

  # Cheat and bypass Rails in development mode if the client attempts to download a static asset
  # that's already been downloaded.
  #
  # Also ensures that assets are not cached in development mode. Around Chrome 29, the behavior
  # of `must-revalidate` changed and would often not request assets that had changed.
  #
  #  To use, include in your project and add the following to development.rb:
  #
  #  require 'middleware/turbo_dev'
  #  config.middleware.insert 0, Middleware::TurboDev
  #
  class TurboDev
    def initialize(app, settings={})
      @app = app
