  patch :DATA

  # Correct an issue where internal third-party libs (libminizip and liburiparser)
  # are installed as dylibs. liburiparser conflicts with uriparser formula.
  # libminizip conflicts with new formula, and some of its symbols have been
  # renamed with prefixes of "libkml_", i.e, can't be linked against for other builds
  # Fix just forces internal libs to be linked statically until the following
  # is addressed upstream: https://code.google.com/p/libkml/issues/detail?id=50
